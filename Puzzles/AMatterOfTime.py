# A Matter of Time
# Fifty minutes ago if it was four times as many minutes past three o'clock, how many minutes is it to six o'clock?

# To start, the total time in minutes between 3 and 6 o'clock is 180 minutes.

# We also know that from some time x before 6 o'clock, and 50 minutes before that was 4x minutes past three o'clock.

# Pictorial timeline broken down into segments (+ indicates time added to go from 3 to 6 o'clock:
# 3 o'clock | +4x | +50 minutes (to get to a time between 5 and 6 o'clock) | +x | 6 o'clock

# Total time between 3 and 6 o'clock is 180 minutes.
# From this timeline we get: 4x + 50 + x = 180 minutes
# This simplifies to 5x = 130 minutes
# x = 26 minutes

# So the current time is 3 o'clock + 4x (where x = 26) + 50 minutes = 5:34
# 5:34 + x minutes (where x = 26) = 6 o'clock
