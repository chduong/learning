# Problem 4
# A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
#
# Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
#
# [ : :-1] = slices list in reverse order.
# [ : :2] = slices list in increments of 2.
# [start:end:steps] = format
