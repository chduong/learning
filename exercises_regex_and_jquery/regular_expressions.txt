Lesson 1: An Introduction, and the ABCs
Regular expressions are extremely useful in extracting information from text such as code, log files, spreadsheets, or even documents.
-Note, everything is essentially a character.
--Can be as simple as writing letters in a line.

Lesson 1½: The 123s
Characters include normal letters, but digits as well. In fact, numbers 0-9 are also just characters and if you look at an ASCII table, they are listed sequentially.
-Digits include 0 to 9.
--\d can be used to replace any digit 0 to 9

Lesson 2: The Dot
The wildcard, which is represented by the . (dot) metacharacter, and can match any single character (letter, digit, whitespace, everything).
-If you need a period, do \.
 ...\.

Lesson 3: Matching specific characters
Matching specific characters using regular expressions, by defining them inside square brackets. For example, the pattern [abc] will only match a single a, b, or c letter and nothing else.
[cmf]an Only selects the first letter that is either c or m or f.

Lesson 4: Excluding specific characters
Excludes specific characters using the square brackets and the ^ (hat). For example, the pattern [^abc] will match any single character except for the letters a, b, or c.
[^(b)]og excludes b, but matches everything else (og).

Lesson 5: Character ranges
There is a shorthand for matching a character in list of sequential characters by using the dash to indicate a character range. For example, the pattern [0-6] will only match any single digit character from zero to six, and nothing else. And likewise, [^n-p] will only match any single character except for letters n to p.

Multiple character ranges can also be used in the same set of brackets, along with individual characters. An example of this is the alphanumeric \w metacharacter which is equivalent to the character range [A-Za-z0-9_] and often used to match characters in English text.
[A-C][n-p][a-c] matches only A - C, skips lowercase a - c, then goes to next letter, matches n-p, then next letter and a-c.

Lesson 6: Catching some zzz's
Repetitions of characters: One way that we can do this is to explicitly spell out exactly how many characters we want, eg. \d\d\d which would match exactly three digits.

A more convenient way is to specify how many repetitions of each character we want using the curly braces notation. For example, a{3} will match the a character exactly three times. Certain regular expression engines will even allow you to specify a range for this repetition such that a{1,3} will match the a character no more than 3 times, but no less than once for example.

This quantifier can be used with any character, or special metacharacters, for example w{3} (three w's), [wxy]{5} (five characters, each of which can be a w, x, or y) and .{2,6} (between two and six of any character).
waz{3,5}up

Lesson 7: Mr. Kleene, Mr. Kleene
Powerful concept: match an arbitrary number of characters. For example, imagine that you wrote a form that has a donation field that takes a numerical value in dollars. A wealthy user may drop by and want to donate $25,000, while a normal user may want to donate $25.

One way to express such a pattern would be to use what is known as the Kleene Star and the Kleene Plus, which essentially represents either 0 or more or 1 or more of the character that it follows (it always follows a character or group). For example, to match the donations above, we can use the pattern \d* to match any number of digits, but a tighter regular expression would be \d+ which ensures that the input string has at least one digit.

These quantifiers can be used with any character or special metacharacters, for example a+ (one or more a's), [abc]+ (one or more of any a, b, or c character) and .* (zero or more of any character).
aa+b*c+

Lesson 8: Characters optional
Another quantifier that is really common when matching and extracting text is the ? (question mark) metacharacter which denotes optionality. This metacharacter allows you to match either zero or one of the preceding character or group. For example, the pattern ab?c will match either the strings "abc" or "ac" because the b is considered optional.

Similar to the dot metacharacter, the question mark is a special character and you will have to escape it using a slash \? to match a plain question mark character in a string.
\d+ files? found\? the s? makes s optional, while \? return ?

Lesson 9: All this whitespace
The most common forms of whitespace you will use with regular expressions are the space (␣), the tab (\t), the new line (\n) and the carriage return (\r) (useful in Windows environments), and these special characters match each of their respective whitespaces. In addition, a whitespace special character \s will match any of the specific whitespaces above and is extremely useful when dealing with raw input text.
[1-3]\.\s+abc

Lesson 10: Starting and ending
One way to tighten our patterns is to define a pattern that describes both the start and the end of the line using the special ^ (hat) and $ (dollar sign) metacharacters. In the example above, we can use the pattern ^success to match only a line that begins with the word "success", but not the line "Error: unsuccessful operation". And if you combine both the hat and the dollar sign, you create a pattern that matches the whole line completely at the beginning and end.

Note that this is different than the hat used inside a set of bracket [^...] for excluding characters, which can be confusing when reading regular expressions.
^Mission: successful$ start at ^ and end at $

Lesson 11: Match groups
Regular expressions allow us to not just match text but also to extract information for further processing. This is done by defining groups of characters and capturing them using the special parentheses ( and ) metacharacters. Any subpattern inside a pair of parentheses will be captured as a group. In practice, this can be used to extract information like phone numbers or emails from all sorts of data.

Imagine for example that you had a command line tool to list all the image files you have in the cloud. You could then use a pattern such as ^(IMG\d+\.png)$ to capture and extract the full filename, but if you only wanted to capture the filename without the extension, you could use the pattern ^(IMG\d+)\.png$ which only captures the part before the period.
^(file.+)\.pdf$

Lesson 12: Nested groups
Take the example from the previous lesson, of capturing the filenames of all the image files you have in a list. If each of these image files had a sequential picture number in the filename, you could extract both the filename and the picture number using the same pattern by writing an expression like ^(IMG(\d+))\.png$ (using a nested parenthesis to capture the digits).

The nested groups are read from left to right in the pattern, with the first capture group being the contents of the first parentheses group, etc.
(\w+ (\d+))

Lesson 13: More group work
All the quantifiers including the star *, plus +, repetition {m,n} and the question mark ? can all be used within the capture group patterns. This is the only way to apply quantifiers on sequences of characters instead of the individual characters themselves.

For example, if I knew that a phone number may or may not contain an area code, the right pattern would test for the existence of the whole group of digits (\d{3})? and not the individual characters themselves (which would be wrong).
(\d+)x(\d+)

Lesson 14: It's all conditional
It's always good to be precise, and that applies to coding, talking, and even regular expressions. For example, you wouldn't write a grocery list for someone to Buy more .* because you would have no idea what you could get back. Instead you would write Buy more milk or Buy more bread, and in regular expressions, we can actually define these conditionals explicitly.

Specifically when using groups, you can use the | (logical OR, aka. the pipe) to denote different possible sets of characters. In the above example, I can write the pattern "Buy more (milk|bread|juice)" to match only the strings Buy more milk, Buy more bread, or Buy more juice.

Like normal groups, you can use any sequence of characters or metacharacters in a condition, for example, ([cb]ats*|[dh]ogs?) would match either cats or bats, or, dogs or hogs. Writing patterns with many conditions can be hard to read, so you should consider making them separate patterns if they get too complex.
I love (cats|dogs)

Lesson 15: Other special characters
We have already learned the most common metacharacters to capture digits using \d, whitespace using \s, and alphanumeric letters and digits using \w, but regular expressions also provides a way of specifying the opposite sets of each of these metacharacters by using their upper case letters. For example, \D represents any non-digit character, \S any non-whitespace character, and \W any non-alphanumeric character (such as punctuation). Depending on how you compose your regular expression, it may be easier to use one or the other.

Additionally, there is a special metacharacter \b which matches the boundary between a word and a non-word character. It's most useful in capturing entire words (for example by using the pattern \w+\b).

One concept that we will not explore in great detail in these lessons is back referencing, mostly because it varies depending on the implementation. However, many systems allow you to reference your captured groups by using \0 (usually the full matched text), \1 (group 1), \2 (group 2), etc. This is useful for example when you are in a text editor and doing a search and replace using regular expressions to swap two numbers, you can search for "(\d+)-(\d+)" and replace it with "\2-\1" to put the second captured number first, and the first captured number second for example.

Lazy solution to take everything: .* = wildcard from zero to any number of any character.

ALL of this can now be applied to your python code. Have fun!
